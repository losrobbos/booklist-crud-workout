# Book List Mini App (React)

The Book List app is a nice training app for practicing React state and props.

Demo: https://book-app-rose.vercel.app

We will apply the four essential CRUD operations:
- C - Create: Add new book entries to the list
- R - Read: Filter entries in the list when user types a searchterm (=> filter means: HIDING infos, not deleting!)
- U - Update: Update a book by an inline form (by toggling from a VIEW state of a book to an EDIT state)
- D - Delete: Remove a book from the list

This app uses a simplified setup:
- just Components, Events, State and Props
- No React Router
- No Context
- And nothing even more complicated :)

## Enjoy!

Try to rebuild this thing on your own!

Never copy paste, young grasshopper! Trust me, you do not get anything out of it...
(but "stealing" code by looking it up, memoizing a piece and trying to apply it on our own, building the app up step by step, is a good thing, of course :))
